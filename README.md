Level 1

    a number between 1 and 100. The user has to guess
    the number, and the program will give feedback if the
    guess is too high or too low.

  Could you give the user multiple attempts to guess the number?
  Provide appropriate feedback (e.g: "Too high" or "Too low").

  maximum number of attempts.
